There is solution for object classification here.

what you can find here:
1. visualisation of input data you can find in notebook "visualisation_input_data.ipynb". 
2. cutting and resizing objects from image for training you can find in "data_generator.py"
3. there are training, computing errors ans errors visualisation in "train.ipynd"
4. and there are models, trained by me, in models.py
